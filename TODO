  Clean up edge pixels around the man. (MUST) <-- DECIDED NOT TO DO.
  Integrate the briefcase finding code with the main loop. (MUST) <--- DONE.
  Add more heuristics to the briefcase plane finding for termination. (OPTIONAL) <-- DONE.
  Crop the briefcase image to not have the black border. (OPTIONAL) <-- DONE.
  Run a gaussian kernel over it to smooth the final image. (OPTIONAL) <-- DONE.
  Adjust the lighting of the background image with respect to the scene lighting. (OPTIONAL) <-- DONE.
